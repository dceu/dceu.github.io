      <description>The Mario Journey Divided into 7 problem sets or psets as referenced in the originial repo, Mario is the application that students will code. I will publish my walkthrough here, beginning with pset1.
First Fork The first step, as noted by the README.md is to fork the original repository. A guide to how to do that can be found here.
ok got it. Check out my fork. Going to add ToDos along with each pset to make it easier to just dig in and code.</description>
