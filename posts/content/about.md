## About Me
 I'm 25. Dropped out of college at the end of 2015. It was expensive. Figured I could learn at least the C.S. side of my Computer Engineering
free of charge, bureaucracy, and exam anxiety. Funny though, I have an open tab to view the correct spelling of "bureaucracy" and the most Java I ever learned was from a  [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/java-in-depth:become-a-complete-java-engineer.beauracracy) . I guess certain structures work for me. 

### Anyways
  This is my site. I'll blog, retheme, muse, or whatever here. Mostly, I'll be working with towards landing an apprenticeship through Launchcode.com.
You can track that progress on [github](https://github.com/dceu/launchcode-java-class)

#### wish me luck!
