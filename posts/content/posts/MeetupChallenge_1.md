Hosted by [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html) presented by [Michael Carducci](https://www.trulymagic.com).

# Nielsen
The presentation opened with a bit about Nielsen. "It's a big data company." Core business is *making sense of the data with technology*. Sounds nifty. 

# Data Science
My understanding of data science is an aggregate collection of discrete data points, and then presented in a a manner worth digesting --  i.e. [Jupyter Books](https://jupyter.org). These days, you can find a Masters Degree program at your local university for *business analytics* which seems like the modern progression of MIS, from my parents' generation. As it leverages AI alongside Machine Learning technologies to return behavioral & statistical analysis of ... i guess whatever the parameters for the study are. In Nielsen's case it's advertisements, media consumed, and then purchases made. Where are the correlations? This seems to be what Nielsen is about from their newer digital methods, to the time-tested phone call survey.
