MeetUps
==========

Being a social-recluse, when not confined to the depths of the restaurant kitchen night shifts for the past 4~ish years, I'm accustomed to a certain workplace culture.

So for the next 3 months, and perhaps into the next year, I have added Tampa Bay Tech MeetUps to my calendar. Groups among these include Tampa Bay 
Java User Group (TJUG), Tampa Bay Brigade, Thinkful Tampa, Tampa Bay Agile (acceptance pending), Tampa Python, Barcamp, and more. 

I'll keep posting my finds.

### To Do:
- [ ] Set up calendar on blog.
