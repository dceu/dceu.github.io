            <p>Hello World! My name is Donovan. I&rsquo;m 25, residing in Tampa, Florida seeking opportunities in Software Development. I have been learning Java from this Udemy class, and doing work with Launchcode.tv

            <p>Mario Pset 3 Overview: In this problem set, we&rsquo;re going to refactor so that a Pyramid class encapsulates the core logic. Next, ensure that the printer interface only accepts Pyramids. Will implement a &ldquo;toString&rdquo; method on the Pyramid object, overriding the methods inherited from the Object class built in to Java. Finally we&rsquo;re going to implement the Factory Design Pattern to hide the instatiation of the Pyramid objects.
Pyramid object In Java, everything is a sublcass of the Object class, and inherits all of its methods. <br>. . .<a class="read-more" href="/mario3/"> more --></a></p>

            <p>The Mario Journey Divided into 7 problem sets or psets as referenced in the originial repo, Mario is the application that students will code. I will publish my walkthrough here, beginning with pset1.
First Fork The first step, as noted by the README.md is to fork the original repository. A guide to how to do that can be found here.
ok got it. Check out my fork. Going to add ToDos along with each pset to make it easier to just dig in and code. <br>. . .<a class="read-more" href="/mario/"> more --></a></p>

Handle exceptions Implement the above functionality according to Strategy Design. Commit and push!  let&rsquo;s go!  Strategy Design To avoid future refactoring, and since we already have the print to console functionality coded, let&rsquo;s add this new implementation with Stragegy Design in mind. <br>. . .<a class="read-more" href="/mario2/"> more --></a></p>

            <p>Introduction: This post begins my series on algorithms. We will explore a set of common problem archetypes, outline design elements, and finally analyze these solutions as coded in Java, along with the runtime complexity in Big O time.
Problem Archetype: In the &ldquo;Two Sum&rdquo; problem, we are looking for two numbers that exist in a given array adding up to a given target number. For this instance, this array is unorderd, and has no dupes. <br>. . .<a class="read-more" href="/twosum/"> more --></a></p>

            <p>MeetUps Being a social-recluse, when not confined to the depths of the restaurant kitchen night shifts for the past 4~ish years, I&rsquo;m accustomed to a certain workplace culture.
So for the next 3 months, and perhaps into the next year, I have added Tampa Bay Tech MeetUps to my calendar. Groups among these include Tampa Bay Java User Group (TJUG), Tampa Bay Brigade, Thinkful Tampa, Tampa Bay Agile (acceptance pending), Tampa Python, Barcamp, and more. <br>. . .<a class="read-more" href="/meetupchallenge/"> more --></a></p>
